# CircuitNet: An Open-Source Dataset for Machine Learning Applications in Electronic Design Automation (EDA)

## Overview 
This repository is intended to hosts codes and demos for CircuitNet, we hope this codebase would be helpful for users to reproduce exiting methods. Pretrianed weights will be available soon.

```
usage: test.py [--task TASK_NAME]  [--pretrained PRETRAINED_WEIGHTS_PATH] 
```
Change the configure to fit your file path and hyper-parameter in [config.py](utils/configs.py).

More information about the dataset can be accessed from our [web page](https://circuitnet.github.io/).

## Prerequisites

All dependencies can be installed using pip:

```sh
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Our experiments run on Python 3.9 and PyTorch 1.11. Other versions should work but are not tested.

## Data Preparation
Please download and extract files from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GjW-1LBx1563bg3pHQGvhcEyK2A9sYUB) and [Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1evSTtuvphyl1_aSedsEQLA?pwd=wihf).

## Example Usage:

### Test

#### Congestion
```python
python test.py --task congestion_gpdl --pretrained PRETRAINED_WEIGHTS_PATH
```


#### DRC
```python
python test.py --task drc_routenet --pretrained PRETRAINED_WEIGHTS_PATH --save_as_npy True
```

#### IR Drop
```python
python test.py --task irdrop_mavi --pretrained PRETRAINED_WEIGHTS_PATH --save_as_npy True
```


### Train
#### Congestion
```python
python train.py --task congestion_gpdl --save_path work_dir/congestion_gpdl/
```


#### DRC
```python
python train.py --task drc_routenet --save_path work_dir/drc_routenet/
```

#### IR Drop
```python
python train.py --task irdrop_mavi --save_path work_dir/irdrop_mavi/
```
